Part 1 of the Sorting Lab in Week 3 CISC 187
## Task 1
The time complexity of an algorithm that takes 4N + 16 steps would be defined as O(N) in Big-O notation. The reason for this being that as N grows the constant values 4 and 16 become negligible, making the time complexity essentially N.

## Task 2
Much like task 1 we can drop our constant values. In this case an algorithm that takes 2N^2 steps would simplify to O(N^2) in Big-O notation.
